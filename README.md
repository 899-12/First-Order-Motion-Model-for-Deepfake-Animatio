# First-Order Motion Model for Deepfake Animation

This project implements a **First-Order Motion Model** to animate a static image using the motion dynamics extracted from a driving video. It demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques to create realistic deepfake animations by transferring motion from a video to a still image.

## Introduction

This project uses the **First-Order Motion Model for Image Animation** by Aliaksandra Siarohin et al. to generate animations where a static image mimics the movements and expressions from a driving video. 

**Key Concepts:**
- Motion representation via keypoints.
- Warping the source image based on driving video dynamics.
- Generating realistic animations using a trained model.

**Applications:**
- Content creation for media and entertainment.
- Virtual avatars for games and AR/VR applications.
- Educational tools to demonstrate AI capabilities.

## Features

- Animate any static image using a driving video.
- Supports side-by-side visualization of the source image, driving video, and generated animation.
- Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for fast and high-quality results.

## How It Works

1. **Input Preparation**:
   - A static image and a driving video are preprocessed to have the same resolution (`256x256`).
   
2. **Model Loading**:
   - A pre-trained generator and keypoint detector are loaded using provided configuration and checkpoint files.

3. **Animation Generation**:
   - Motion from the driving video is transferred to the static image using the trained model.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Outputs are displayed as an animation comparing the source image, driving video, and generated results.
